				<p>Growing up in Juneau, Alaska, I was alwasy surounded by nature. I would spend my summer afternoons hiking out to the glacier, or fishing for Salmon on my father's boat. Being raised in this unique envrioment helped shape me into the person who I am today. I am someone who always has taught myself new skills, and strived to become someone who can help a team. This went as far as me joing the rugby team while I was in college when I had never even seen rugby being played before. By the time I was a Senior, I was able to contribute to the team, and helped us become a top 16 team in the country. This passion and drive for self improvment also helped me teach myself to program. </p>

			<p>While studying at the Universtiy of Denver, my main focus was on trying to get into medical school. I graduated with a B.S. in Biology, with minors in Chemistry, Psychology, and Leadership Studies, and then went looking for a job in the medical field. My first job was working at an assisted living facility as a Certfied Nursing Assistant (CNA), and as a Qaulified Medicine Administering Person (QMAP). This experience let me work hands on with lots of different patients, and I was able to make those very personal connections with them. While I did learn a lot about medicine during my time there, I also learned that becoming a doctor is not the path I wanted to take. In the summer of 2020 when everything was still closed due to the pandemic, I used my free time to teach myself programing. I started with FreeCodeCamp, and then moved onto buidling my own projects.</p>
